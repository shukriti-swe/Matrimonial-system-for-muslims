			Match Made In Jannah requests every member to be honest with each other. It is better, to tell the truth than to hide behind lies which only leads to destruction. <br /><br />

			When marriage is discussed between two people, they start to plan their life with hopes and dreams full of aspirations
			which form the foundation of their decision to move forward. They effectively put their heart & soul on the line.
			However, there could be times, when certain people are dishonest and try to mislead or play games for their own
			interests, not realizing how devastating and hurtful the other person will be. So, we request everyone to make wise
			judgments before trusting someone. <br /><br />

			Muhammad (SAW) said there are three things in Islam which are not matters to be joked about, and the first of these is
			marriage. <br /><br />

			Furthermore, the Prophet SAW said that the angels distance themselves from the liar, and this is an evil trait that is not
			a characteristic that we desire from our candidates. 
			<br /><br />

			Abdullah bin Umar (RA) relates that the Prophet SAW said: When a person lies, the angel distances himself from the liar by a mile." (Tirmidhi). <br /><br />

			The Prophet SAW said: â€˜There are three things which, whether undertaken seriously or in jest, are treated as serious: 
			<br /><br />
			<ul>
				<li>Marriage</li>
				<li>Divorce</li>
				<li>Taking back a wife (after a divorce which is not final).</li>
			</ul>Sunan of Abu-Dawood Hadith 2189, Narrated by Abu Hurayrah: Match Made In Jannah, wants to see everyone find their partners which Allah has created for each and every one of you, so please start by being honest. <br /><br />
