			<b>1. How Do I Register? </b><br />
			<br /><br />
			<b>2. How Old Do You Have To Be To Become A Member? </b><br />
			You have to be 18 years or older to register. <br /><br />
			<b>3. What are the steps I need to take to change my email address? </b><br />
			<br /><br />
			<b>4. I want to stay anonymous, is it necessary to fill in my real name & email address? </b><br />
			Yes, you need to fill in the correct information. Do not worry, your name and email address are private, and are only used for administrative purposes.
			You will be prompted to create a unique username for yourself, and this is the name that other people will see.
			Your true identity will always be hidden to all members until you reveal it yourself.
			<br /><br />
			<b>5. Can I register on behalf of someone else? </b><br />
			Yes, as long as the person whom you registered is aware of it.
			<br /><br />
			<b>6. Can I change my username later? </b><br />
			Sorry, you may NOT change your username, because once you have communicated with other members using a username, this username is what everyone recognizes you with, and so if you change it, this would cause confusion among all with whom you communicated.
			Please, NEVER use your real name.
			<br /><br />
			<b>7. Can we register more than one account? </b><br />
			No, you should only register with one account. It is against our rules for a member to have more than one account.
			If we find members who deliberately create additional accounts we will have no choice but to suspend them.
			<br /><br />
			<b>8. How to change password after signing in? </b><br />
			<br /><br />
			<b>9. Important Notes On Photos & Video </b><br />
			Do I have to upload a photo?
			No, uploading your photo/video is completely optional. However, many members find early establishment of physical attraction very important in their search for a spouse, you may find that your profile generates less interest without a photos/video. .
			<br /><br />
			<b>10. Can I share my photos/video by email or iPhone instead?</b><br />
			We strongly advise against this as this would necessitate sharing your personal contact information also, once you have obtained a little trust and have mutual understanding only then you should take baby steps to fully trust someone. Remember, your photos & personal information could easily be saved and distributed by the recipient.
			<br /><br />
			<b>11. Who has access to my photo/video if I upload it?</b><br />
			Your photos/video remain completely private, and are only visible to:
			Male Photos/Video : Male Administrators
			Female Photos/Video: Female Administrators
			They will have access to all photos of members whom you have granted access to.
			<br /><br />
			<b>12. My profile photo keeps getting rejected, why?</b><br />
			Profile photos have to meet the following criteria: All photos must be in color, close up, clear, bright, try not to have others in your picture, NO side profiles please, and all photos must be recent (1-3months).
			<br /><br />
			<b>13. Can I revoke Access? </b><br />

			<br /><br />
			<b>14. I have uploaded my photo/video but I do not see it displayed. Amin you want to add something here </b><br />

			<br /><br />
			<b>15. How can I reactivate my account? </b><br />

			<br /><br />
			<b>16. Can I change my email address? </b><br />

			<br /><br />
			<b>17. Why do I need to be honest? </b><br />
			Prophet Muhammad SAW said there are three things in Islam which are not matters to be joked about, and the first of these is marriage.
			Sunan of Abu-Dawood Hadith 2189, Narrated by Abu Hurayrah: The Prophet SAW said: There are three things which, whether undertaken seriously or in jest, are treated as serious: Marriage, divorce and taking back a wife (after a divorce which is not final).
			If you are a good Muslim, you know the value of honesty. Marriage is a sacred bond that two people share together, which is filled with LOVE, and love comes from effective communication, understanding, & compromise, and TRUST holds the relationship together.
			Furthermore, the Prophet SAW said that the angels distance themselves from the liar, and this evil trait is not a characteristic we desire from our candidates.
			Abdullah bin Umar (RA) relates that Prophet SAW said: When a person lies, the angel distances himself from the liar by a mile." (Tirmidhi)
