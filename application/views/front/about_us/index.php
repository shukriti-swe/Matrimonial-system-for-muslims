			Welcome to Match Made in Jannah! Our mission is to help fellow Muslims find the right partner. In this day and age, technology has made it simple to connect with others all around the world, yet forming genuine connections based on mutual interests and goals, remains challenging.<br /><br />

			Match Made in Jannah has a solution for that! We allow members to directly screen potential love interests through not only picture profiles but video profiles as well. Video profiles offer an advantage to traditional picture profiles in that viewers can see and hear the way their potential love match speak and get to know them on a more personal
			level, before reaching out and a2empting to make a connection with them. Videos allow a more in-depth view into someone's personality and character and offer that extra step that most traditional sites are missing.  <br /><br />
			Furthermore, at Match Made in Jannah, we have made sure to offer you an unparalleled database with people in all age ranges and walks of life to ensure there is someone for everyone!<br /><br />

			May Allah (SWT) guide and help you find the perfect match that was made in Jannah just for you. We hope that through Match Made In Jannah you will find that soul mate.<br /><br />
