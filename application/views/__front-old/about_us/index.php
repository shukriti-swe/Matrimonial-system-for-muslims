Welcome to Match Made in Jannah! Our mission is to help fellow Muslims find the right partner. In this day and age, technology has made it simple to connect with others all around the world, yet forming genuine connections based on mutual interests and goals, still remains challenging. <br/><br/>

Match Made in Jannah has a solution for that! We allow members to directly screen potential love interests through not only picture profiles, but video profiles as well. Video profiles offer an advantage to traditional picture profiles in that viewers are able to see and hear the way their potential love match speak and get to know them on a more personal level, prior to reaching out and attempting to make a connection with them. Videos allow a more in depth view into someone's personality and character, and offers that extra step that most traditional sites are missing.  <br/><br/> 

Furthermore, at Match Made in Jannah we have made sure to offer you an unparalleled database with people in all age ranges and walks of life to ensure there is someone for everyone! <br/><br/> 
May Allah (SWT) guide and help you find your perfect match that was made in Jannah just for you. We hope that we can help you along the way to find that soul mate. <br/><br/> 

So come on,  start your journey with us.<br/><br/>
